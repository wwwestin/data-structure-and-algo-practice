// Write a function, pairSum, that takes in an array and a target sum as arguments. The 
// function should return an array containing a pair of indices whose elements sum to 
// the given target. The indices returned must be unique.

// Be sure to return the indices, not the elements themselves.

// There is guaranteed to be one such pair that sums to the target.


const pairSum = (numbers, targetSum) => {
    

  };

  console.log(pairSum([3, 2, 5, 4, 1], 8));
