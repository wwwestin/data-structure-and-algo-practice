// Write a function, fiveSort, that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. The function should 
// rearrange elements of the array such that all 5s appear at the end. Your function should perform this operation 
// in-place by mutating the original array. The function should return the array.

// Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the output, as long as all 5s are at the end of the array.



const fiveSort = (nums) => {
    
};

console.log(fiveSort([12, 5, 1, 5, 12, 7]));
